# Rating Prediction using Collaborative Filtering

This project predicts customers' clothes ratings from data of clothes measurements, customers' body measurements, fit feedback, and reviews using 3 models:
1. Bag of words model with linear regression
2. Collaborative filtering model with Jaccard similarity
3. Latent factor model

## Roadmap

- Rating Prediction.ipynb: code for exploratory data analysis, data wrangling and machine learning models to predict customer ratings
- Rating Prediction Report.pdf: report that discusses the methods, models, and results
